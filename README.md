# Real-Time-Clouds-Rendering

This project report is intended to address the details of implementing the method for realistic real-time rendering of clouds. The project is implemented with OpenGL/C++, which implements both shading and rendering algorithm and dynamic impostor generation technique. The report will illustrate both mathematical concepts of rendering techniques and detailed explanations of OpenGL/C++ implementation. Since this cloud rendering technique is intended to be used for games and flight simulators, this report will also explain how to implement first person view camera and the skybox to realize a flying environment.
